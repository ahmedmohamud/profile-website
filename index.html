            This is ahmed, who came up with a new profile website by using a simple coding.<br>
        </p>

             he also applies the html as well as css 
            so as to make the new profile website looks more attractive and decorative.<br>
            <b/>
            
             This ahmed likes my new website profile to develop better.
              It takes few minutes to create a website if one has a knowledge related to htmlas well as css.
